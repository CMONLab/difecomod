Description: Implements the differential co-occurrence analysis methodology for detecting 
    ecological modules that change between host conditions in microbiome data.
    The package provides functions for computing co-occurrence frequencies, differential co-occurrence statistical testing, higher-order interaction analysis, and network visualization. 
    The method is designed for metagenomic sequencing data from clinical microbiome studies but is applicable to ecological data in general.
