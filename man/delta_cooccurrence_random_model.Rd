\title{Random Model for Differential Co-occurrence Analysis}
\usage{
delta_cooccurrence_random_model(X1occ, X2occ, n = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1occ}{Binary occurrence matrix for condition 1 (samples x taxa)}

\item{X2occ}{Binary occurrence matrix for condition 2 (samples x taxa)}

\item{n}{Number of random column shuffling (default: 5000)}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \item{Values}{Matrix of null co-occurrence models (n_shufflings x n_cooccurrences)}
  \item{Stats}{Data frame with mean, median, SD, and 5\% and 95\% percentile values of null co-occurrence models}
}
\description{
Generates null distribution by randomly shuffling occurrence patterns
within each taxon while preserving overall occurrence frequencies.
}
\details{
The random model tests whether observed differential co-occurrence patterns
could arise by chance given the individual occurrence frequencies of each taxon.
This is achieved by randomly shuffling the occurrence patterns within each
taxon column, breaking any co-occurrence structure while preserving marginal
occurrence rates.

\examples{
# Create example data
set.seed(42)
X1 <- matrix(rbinom(40, 1, 0.6), nrow = 8, ncol = 5)
X2 <- matrix(rbinom(35, 1, 0.4), nrow = 7, ncol = 5)
colnames(X1) <- colnames(X2) <- paste0("Taxa_", 1:5)

# Generate null model (use small n for example)
null_random <- delta_cooccurrence_random_model(X1, X2, n = 100)
head(null_random$Stats)
