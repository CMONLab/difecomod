\title{Construct Differential Co-occurrence Network}
\usage{
construct_network_delta(
  delta_I = NULL,
  links_I = NULL,
  nodes_I = NULL,
  stat_thr_rand = NULL,
  stat_thr_perm = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta_I}{Numeric vector of observed differential co-occurrence values}

\item{links_I}{List of taxa pair indices corresponding to delta_I}

\item{nodes_I}{Character vector of node (taxa) names}

\item{stat_thr_rand}{list of 2 containing $ lower and $ upper statistical thresholds (from delta_cooccurrence_random_model)}

\item{stat_thr_perm}{list of 2 containing $ lower and $ upper statistical thresholds (from delta_cooccurrence_permutation_model)}
}
\value{
Adjacency matrix representing the differential co-occurrence network.
  Values: +1 = over-represented in condition 1, -1 = under-represented in condition 1,
  0 = not significant

The sign indicates the direction of the differential co-occurrence.
}
\description{
Creates a network representation of significant differential co-occurrences
based on random and permutation model thresholds.
