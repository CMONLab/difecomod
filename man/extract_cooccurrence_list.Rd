\title{Extract Pairwise Co-occurrence Frequencies}
\usage{
extract_cooccurrence_list(Xocc)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xocc}{Binary occurrence matrix (samples x taxa). Columns represent taxa,
rows represent samples. Matrix elements are 1 for presence and 0 for absence.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{O}{Numeric vector of co-occurrence frequencies for all taxa pairs}
  \item{I}{List of index pairs corresponding to each co-occurrence frequency}
}
\description{
Computes the frequency at which each pair of taxa co-occur across samples
in a binary occurrence matrix. This is a core function for differential
co-occurrence analysis.
}
\details{
For each pair of taxa (i,j), the co-occurrence frequency is calculated as:
\deqn{O_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{ki} \cdot X_{kj}}{n}}
where n is the number of samples, and X_ki indicates presence/absence of taxon i in sample k.
}
\examples{
# Create example binary occurrence matrix
set.seed(123)
occurrence_matrix <- matrix(rbinom(40, 1, 0.5), nrow = 8, ncol = 5)
rownames(occurrence_matrix) <- paste0("Sample_", 1:8)
colnames(occurrence_matrix) <- paste0("Taxa_", 1:5)

# Extract co-occurrence frequencies
result <- extract_cooccurrence_list(occurrence_matrix)
print(head(result$O))  # Co-occurrence frequencies
print(head(result$I))  # Taxa pair indices
