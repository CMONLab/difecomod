\title{Permutation Model for Differential Co-occurrence Analysis}
\usage{
delta_cooccurrence_permutation_model(X1occ, X2occ, n = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1occ}{Binary occurrence matrix for condition 1}

\item{X2occ}{Binary occurrence matrix for condition 2}

\item{n}{Number of group permutations (default: 5000)}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \item{Values}{Matrix of null co-occurrence models (n_permutations x n_cooccurrences)}
  \item{Stats}{Data frame with mean, median, SD, and 5\% and 95\% percentile values of null co-occurrence models}
}
\description{
Generates null distribution by randomly permuting sample condition labels
while preserving group sizes and overall sample structure.
}
\details{
The permutation model tests whether differential co-occurrence patterns
could arise simply from random assignment of samples to conditions,
preserving the actual group sizes but randomizing which samples belong
to which condition.

\examples{
set.seed(42)
X1 <- matrix(rbinom(40, 1, 0.6), nrow = 8, ncol = 5)
X2 <- matrix(rbinom(35, 1, 0.4), nrow = 7, ncol = 5)

null_perm <- delta_cooccurrence_permutation_model(X1, X2, n = 100)
head(null_perm$Stats)
