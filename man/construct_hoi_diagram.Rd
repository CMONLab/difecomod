\usage{
construct_hoi_diagram(
  delta_I = NULL,
  links_I = NULL,
  nodes_I = NULL,
  stat_thr_rand = NULL,
  stat_thr_perm = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta_I}{Numeric vector of observed differential HOI values (condition 1 - condition 2)}

\item{links_I}{List of triplet indices, where each element contains three feature indices}

\item{nodes_I}{Character vector of node (taxa) names involved in the triplets}

\item{stat_thr_rand}{List of 2 containing $lower and $upper statistical thresholds 
(from delta_hoi_random_model)}

\item{stat_thr_perm}{List of 2 containing $lower and $upper statistical thresholds 
(from delta_hoi_permutation_model)}
}
\value{
Matrix where rows are features and columns are significant triplets.
  Values: +1 = over-represented in condition 1 (healthy), 
          -1 = under-represented in condition 1 (enriched in condition 2/disease),
          0 = not significant.
  Returns 0 if no significant HOI detected.

The sign indicates the direction of differential HOI. This function creates an
UpSet-style visualization matrix where each column represents one significant triplet
and rows show which taxa are involved.
}
\description{
Creates a matrix representation of significant triplet interactions for 
visualization, combining results from both random and permutation model thresholds.
